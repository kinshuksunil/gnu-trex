= Introduction =
Discuss the name of the project "t-racks" and see what other options we have here.


== Issue with Current Name ==

The name T-RackS (http://www.ikmultimedia.com/t-racks/features/) is a registered trademark of IK Multimedia and we might be under a potential copyright violation if we use the name. So the better option will be to use a name that doesnt exist yet.

== Name Suggestions ==
Submit name suggestions here in the format: *[Name]: [Meaning]*, where
*Name* is the suggested name for the project and *Meaning* is the meaning implied by the name, if it does mean anything.
